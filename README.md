# TEST YOUR REFLEXES
### Development of a game similar to whack-a-mole where the player needs to press a button very quickly to test his reflexes.

# What the project does
### Our project consists of:
### Index
- [Main Page](#Main-Page)
- [Game-Page] Game Page
- [Game-Screen] Game Screen
- [Player-Ranking] Player Ranking

## Main Page
- The first page, the player needs to input his username and its age to continue to the next page.
- A validation is in place for the username.
## Game Page
- This is the page were the action happens, you have your game screen where you can play the game and the top 10 ranking of scores.
## Game Screen
- Here you can play the game, just need to press the *Start Button* and try your best to click the *Stop Button* in the best time possible.
- To make it harder the *Stop Button* will happear in random places, perhaps even in places it shouldn't be so have your eyes open and be ready.
## Player Ranking
- Here you can see your score rising or falling or just checking the scores of everyone else.

## Challenges
# HTML
- We are growing used to organize our HTML so that any calls to JavaScript or CSS are functional and easy to understand.
# CSS
- While still learning a lot CSS it is still a minefield of hardships and "why doesn't this work has I want it to" questions.
# Java
- A steep learning curve with issues a long the way but overall functionality was aquired.
